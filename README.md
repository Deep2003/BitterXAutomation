To utilize the program, you can add a csv file with name "input.csv" into the same directory as the main.py file. Upon succesful execution of the program, the directory will have a "output.csv" file with results of the queries. 

To utilize the program via command line with custom arguments, you can indicate -i INPUT and -o OUTPUT in the command line. For example:
"main.py -i input.csv -o output.csv" would set input file as "input.csv" and output file as "output.csv"
